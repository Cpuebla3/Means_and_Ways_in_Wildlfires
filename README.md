# ABM-MCTS-GPU-Framework

**ABM-MCTS-GPU-Framework** is a software framework that combines Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and GPU acceleration using CUDA via CuPy. It simulates wildfire spread and suppression using aerial and ground firefighting agents. The core fire spread model calculations run on a GPU which enables the efficient simulations required for exploring a vast decision space in an uncertain environment.

## 🔥 Framework Overview

### Wildfire Spread Simulation (GPU-based Fire Spread Model GPU-FSM)
- Implements a Rothermel-based fire spread model in CUDA via CuPy.
- Simulates fire spread across a raster landscape using real topographic and fuel data.
- The `SurrogateFireModelROS` class manages the two kernels designed to run on the GPU.
- One of the kernels 

### Agent-Based Firefighting Model
- Built with the Mesa ABM library.
- Agents include airtankers and ground crews.
- Agents can move, drop retardant, or build fire lines.

### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Planner
- Explores action sequences to minimize a reward function composed of area burned and structures destroyed.
- Performs fast forward simulations using GPU-FSM.
- Builds and traverses a search tree to select optimal agent actions.

### Wind Schedules and Uncertainty
- Initial wind conditions are loaded from CSV schedules (`start_min, end_min, speed_mean, speed_std, dir_mean, dir_std`).
- Each benchmark uses two wind schedules: medium uncertainty and high uncertainty.
- Supports stochastic wind forecasts via sampling.

A schedule is a list of `(start, end, speed, direction)` bins. Constructor `wind_speed` / `wind_direction` are used **only** when `wind_schedule is None`. For scheduled runs those two attributes stay at dummy values (often `0` / `220`); look up the active bin with `current_wind(model)` from `wind_schedule_utils.py`.

| Component | Wind it uses |
|-----------|----------------|
| GPU fire model (`FIRE_MODEL_CUDA`) | Multi-phase arrival times, one constant-wind solve per schedule bin. Static speed/dir if `wind_schedule is None`. |
| Live ABM / MCTS truth | The sampled **truth** schedule. MCTS rollouts sample a *future* schedule from `forecast_provider.get_forecast` and prepend past truth bins. |
| `ics_dynamic` | Current **truth** direction → head / flank / heel. |
| `ics_dynamic_mean` | Latest forecast `dir_mean` at *now*. |
| `ics_dynamic_mean_lookahead` | Forecast `dir_mean` at `time + LOOKAHEAD`. |
| `ics_dynamic_truth_lookahead` | Truth direction at `time + LOOKAHEAD` (oracle). |
| `ics_ros_weighted` | Live (truth) fire perimeter ROS. |
| `ics_ros_weighted_mean` | Temporarily injects a mean-only schedule for the ROS query, then restores truth. |
| `ics_truth_burned_buildings` / `ics_mean_burned_buildings` | Precomputed no-suppression burn under truth or mean schedule. |
| `ics_buildings` | Static building counts; wind unused for allocation. |
| DataCollector `wind_speed` / `wind_direction` | Callable reporters via `current_wind` (the active truth-schedule bin). |

Partial collector dumps go to `Model_Partial_Data_Loading.csv`. `dashboard_NO_PLOTTING.py` deletes any leftover file at startup so adding collector columns cannot mix with an old 3-column CSV (`ParserError: Expected 3 fields … saw 5`).

## 📁 Benchmark Scenarios
Three real wildfire landscapes were used:

| Fire Name       | GeoTIFF File                  | Description                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Marshall Fire  | `marshall_enhanced.tif`       | Colorado fire, rapid urban spread.   |
| Camp Fire      | `camp_fire_three_enhanced.tif` | California fire, high damage event.  |
| Esperanza Fire | `cali_test_big_enhanced.tif`  | Complex terrain and wind dynamics.   |

Each scenario is run with two wind settings:
- **Medium Uncertainty** (low variability forecast)
- **High Uncertainty** (greater wind prediction error)

## Benchmark Heuristic Allocation Strategies

To benchmark the performance of the MCTS-based controller, the framework includes a set of **heuristic allocation strategies** that represent some common tactical decision rules that could be implemented for wildfire suppression. All strategies operate within the same simulation environment, asset constraints, and decision interval (**Δt = 120 minutes**) and are implemented as standalone, non-plotting scripts for scalable batch experimentation.

These heuristic policies are intentionally simpler than the MCTS controller and are designed to isolate the value of different information signals (wind, rate of fire spread, and structural exposure) and decision philosophies.

### Strategy Descriptions

**Baseline.**
*Random Allocation* assigns each available asset to a randomly selected open sector at each decision point. It uses no fire behavior, wind, or structural information and serves as a stochastic lower-bound baseline.

**Rate-of-Spread–Driven.**
*ROS–Truth* and *ROS–Mean* prioritize sectors based on the perimeter rate of spread (ROS). Ground crews are assigned to the highest-ROS sectors, while airtankers are sampled with probability proportional to sector ROS. The Truth variant uses ROS computed from the observed fire state, while the Mean variant evaluates ROS under a forecast-mean wind realization.

**Structure–Driven.**
*Structures–Exposure* allocates assets based on static structure counts per sector. *Structures–Outcome (Mean)* and *Structures–Outcome (Truth)* instead use precomputed estimates of buildings that would burn by ( t_{\max} ) under no suppression, using forecast-mean and truth wind schedules respectively, and allocate assets according to projected structural loss.

**Wind–Driven.**
Wind-based strategies classify sectors as head, flanks, or heel relative to wind direction. *Wind–Truth* and *Wind–Mean* use the current truth or forecast-mean wind, respectively, while *Wind–Mean Lookahead* and *Wind–Truth Lookahead* perform classification using wind at ( t + \Delta t ). Crew and airtanker assignments follow fixed head/flank/heel priority rules.
